MeetingScribe AI is a visually stunning, minimalist web application designed to streamline meeting documentation. It leverages the browser's microphone to capture audio, provides a real-time (simulated) transcription, and then uses a powerful LLM via Cloudflare Workers to generate a concise, structured summary. The summary includes key discussion points, action items, and decisions made. The entire experience is contained within a single, elegant interface, focusing on simplicity and efficiency.

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

-   [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed on your machine.
-   A [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up).

To start the local development server, run the following command. This will start the Vite frontend and the Wrangler dev server for the worker.

```bash
bun dev
